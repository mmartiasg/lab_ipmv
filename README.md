# laboratory IPMV

In this lab we are going to run an algorithm on several images with different parameters. The idea behind is to analyze it automatically and hand pick some pictures to study what is really going on behind the hood.

For feature selection a KNeighborsClassifier is trained in that way it is possible by inspecting the coefficients which parameters contributes more to classification for each class.
